## Introduction

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. It is widely used in various fields such as pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection.

This study involves:
- Implementing KNN from scratch.
- Using KNN with popular machine learning libraries.
- Comparing KNN performance with other classification algorithms.
- Analyzing the impact of different preprocessing techniques and distance metrics on the model's performance.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanrivertarik/knearestneighbors.git
cd knn-study

```

## Usage

To run the experiments and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the data**: Prepare the datasets by running the preprocessing scripts.
2. **Train the model**: Train the KNN model using the training scripts.
3. **Evaluate the model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test datasets.

Example commands:

```bash
# Preprocess the data
python preprocess.py --dataset path/to/dataset

# Train the model
python train.py --dataset path/to/preprocessed/dataset

# Evaluate the model
python evaluate.py --model path/to/trained/model --dataset path/to/test/dataset
```

## Datasets

The datasets used in this study are publicly available and can be downloaded from the following sources:

- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Ensure that you download the datasets and place them in the appropriate directory as specified in the preprocessing scripts.

## Experiments

The following experiments are conducted as part of this study:

1. **Baseline KNN**: Implementing KNN from scratch.
2. **Library-Based KNN**: Using scikit-learn to implement KNN.
3. **Distance Metrics**: Analyzing the impact of different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.) on KNN performance.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Analyzing the impact of feature scaling, polynomial features, and other preprocessing techniques.
5. **Model Comparison**: Comparing KNN with other classifiers like logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.
